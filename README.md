## Why 
With the growing number of delivery based services startups in Luanda/Angola such as [Rapidinho](https://www.instagram.com/rapidinho.ao/), [Motaki](https://www.facebook.com/motaaki/), [OGarsom](https://www.instagram.com/ogarcom_entregas/), [Tupuca](http://www.tupuca.com/en/), [Arreiou](https://twitter.com/arreioubs) and many others coming to the market, we felt the need to build a modular mobile aplication that would be intuitive to use and fit the angolan marketplace. Rapidinho is the use case we decided to go with this aplication.
